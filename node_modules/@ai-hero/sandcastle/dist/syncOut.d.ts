/**
 * Sync-out: extract changes from an isolated sandbox back to the host.
 *
 * Two-phase approach:
 * 1. Save phase: eagerly save all artifacts (patches, diff, untracked files)
 *    to `.sandcastle/patches/<timestamp>/` before attempting to apply.
 * 2. Apply phase: apply from the saved directory.
 *    - On success: clean up the patch directory.
 *    - On failure: preserve the patch directory and print recovery commands.
 *
 * Three-prong extraction within each phase:
 * 1. Committed changes: `git format-patch` + `git am --3way`
 * 2. Uncommitted changes (staged + unstaged): `git diff HEAD` + `git apply`
 * 3. Untracked files: `git ls-files --others` + `copyFileOut` each file
